# PostPal Frontend

This repository contains a simple HTML prototype for the PostPal homepage.
The `index.html` file showcases a wireframe with the following sections:

1. **Landing** – headline, subheading and a "Start Planning" button.
2. **Setup Form** – inputs for the number of days, language, platforms, image prompts, content category and tone.
3. **Result Preview** – summary of generated posts with an "Open Content Calendar" button.
4. **Output View** – a basic table layout for daily content details.
5. **Footer** – placeholder links for sharing and exporting data.

Open `index.html` in your browser to preview the layout.
